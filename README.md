# TypeScript Snake

A simple implementation of snake with typescript and HTML5 canvas

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement to develop the game is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). For testing and executing you only need a modern browser with JavaScript enabled.

### Installing

In the command line go to the src folder and execute the following commands, that's it :)

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Deployment

If you want to use the script on a website simple paste the following HTML snippet into your code, with snake.js being the JavaScript file from the dist folder.

```
<canvas id="snake" width="800" height="800"></canvas>
<script src="path/to/snake.js">
```
